What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    Since I wasn't used to Object Oriented Programming prior to starting this assignment, I had to take a little while to understand the concepts better before I could comfortably code it. I think I spent a little too much time in the beginning studying the procedural code. It was easier to figure out abstractly what I meant to do in my own code, begin it, and then look to individual parts of the procedural code for reassurance. I also made sure to study the “one card” example to make sure I really understood Object Oriented Programming, even outside of that particular example. I would definitely recommend future students make sure they are clear on Object Oriented Programming as a whole before starting on any individual part of A2.
